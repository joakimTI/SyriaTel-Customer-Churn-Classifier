    "### Overview\n",
    "Customer acquisition is very costly to businesses, especially in the telecom industry, therefore customer retention is paramount for a business to be successful. Finding ways to retain existing customers is more cost effective than acquiring new customers. This project aims to build a classification model that will predict whether a customer will soon stop doing business with SyriaTel, and suggest measures to reduce customer churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "By developing multiple classification models, Syriatel will be able to determine the factors that increase customer churn rate and proactively employ methods that will improve customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to conduct a thorough analysis of the SyriaTel customer churn data, utilizing multiple classification modeling techniques. The primary goal is to uncover insights into the factors influencing customer churn for SyriaTel, and suggest proactive measures to reduce the churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stake Holders\n",
    "\n",
    "This project targets a diverse audience:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SyriaTel**: SyriaTel's gain is to increase revenue by reducing customer churn rate, which in turn lowers customer acquisition cost. The marketting team can specifically target these customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Third-party Consultants**:  Companies and consultants seeking data-driven insights into customer retention in the Telecommunication industry can utilize these classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reducing Customer Churn Rate:**\n",
    "   - Predict which customers are likely to stop doing business with SyriaTel, the company can then specifically target these customers and improve retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assess the Factors/Features Causing Customer Churn:**\n",
    "   - Analyze the Syritel churn data and determine the features that impact customer churn rate the most. These will provide measures that Syritel can implement proactively to improve customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Develop a Classification Model to Predict SyriaTel's Customer Churn:**\n",
    "   - Build and evaluate multiple classification models using the best features to predict when a customer will likely stop doing business with SyriaTel. Provide stakeholders with a predictive tool for estimating customer churn at Syriatel."
